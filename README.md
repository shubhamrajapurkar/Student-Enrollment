# Student Enrollment Form

## Description
This project is a **Student Enrollment Form** that stores student data in the **STUDENT-TABLE** relation of the **SCHOOL-DB** database using **JsonPowerDB**. The form allows users to save, update, and reset student details such as Roll Number, Full Name, Class, Birth Date, Address, and Enrollment Date. The form implements CRUD operations and ensures data validation, preventing empty fields.

- **High Performance**: Fast data storage and retrieval, thanks to its in-memory caching and indexing.
- **Low Development Time**: Reduces the complexity of database handling.
- **Real-time Analytics**: Built-in real-time analytics capability.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple REST API makes it easy to integrate with the application.

## Release History
